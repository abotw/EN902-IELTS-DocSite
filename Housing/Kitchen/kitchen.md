Food is the source of energy for human beings. In this entry, I would like to record what I ate today.

### November 8, 2025

At noon, I went to _Tang Shang Tang_ and had **a set meal** that included several kinds of steamed buns and a bowl of hot and sour soup. I ate red bean buns and vermicelli buns, while the set also came with beef, pork, and pickled cabbage buns.

In the evening, I had _yangdu fensi_ (a traditional dish made with tripe and glass noodles). Throughout the day, I also drank some milk and green tea.
