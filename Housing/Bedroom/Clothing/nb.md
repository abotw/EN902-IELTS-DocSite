## The Development History of New Balance and Its Business Expansion in China

Among the world’s leading sportswear brands, **New Balance** occupies a unique position. Unlike many of its flashy competitors, New Balance has built its reputation on craftsmanship, comfort, and understated style. Its journey from a small workshop to a global brand is a story of quiet persistence, innovation, and adaptability.

The company’s roots can be traced back to **1906**, when **William J. Riley**, a British immigrant living in Boston, founded the _New Balance Arch Support Company_. His goal was to design shoe inserts that improved balance and comfort—hence the name _New Balance_. For decades, the brand focused mainly on orthopedic products rather than athletic shoes. However, in the 1960s, a turning point came when Riley’s successor, Arthur Hall, created the **Trackster**, the first running shoe with a ripple sole and available in multiple widths. This innovation revolutionized sports footwear by recognizing that every athlete’s foot was different.

During the **1970s running boom** in the United States, New Balance became the brand of choice for serious runners. Unlike Nike or Adidas, which relied heavily on celebrity endorsements, New Balance emphasized product quality and individuality. Its slogan “Endorsed by No One” captured its philosophy of authenticity and independence. The company’s shoes, often handcrafted in the U.S. and the U.K., became known for their durability and comfort, earning a loyal following among athletes and everyday consumers alike.

New Balance entered the **Chinese market in the 1990s**, as China’s economy was rapidly modernizing and its middle class was expanding. At first, the brand was relatively unknown, facing fierce competition from established giants such as Nike, Adidas, and later domestic names like Li-Ning and Anta. However, its image as a “heritage brand” with a strong sense of quality and tradition gradually appealed to Chinese consumers who sought sophistication and authenticity over hype.

In the 2010s, New Balance successfully repositioned itself in China as both a **sportswear and lifestyle brand**. Its classic models—especially the iconic _NB 574_ and _NB 990_ series—became symbols of minimalist fashion, blending comfort with urban style. Collaborations with Chinese designers and limited-edition releases helped the brand connect with younger audiences and the growing streetwear community.

At the same time, New Balance adapted to China’s digital ecosystem. It launched online flagship stores on Tmall and JD.com, expanded its presence on social media platforms like WeChat and Xiaohongshu, and introduced customized products to cater to local preferences. The company also localized its marketing campaigns by emphasizing values such as perseverance, craftsmanship, and individuality—qualities deeply admired in Chinese culture.

Despite strong competition, New Balance has carved out a stable niche in China’s premium sportswear market. Its success lies in its balance—staying true to its heritage while embracing modern trends.

From a small workshop in Boston to a respected global name, New Balance’s story is one of **endurance, authenticity, and evolution**. In China, as in the rest of the world, the brand continues to prove that true strength doesn’t always need to shout—it can simply walk with confidence.
