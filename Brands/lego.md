## The Development History of LEGO and Its Business Expansion in China

Few toys in the world have left such an enduring mark on childhood as LEGO. Known for its colorful interlocking bricks, the brand has not only inspired generations of children to build, imagine, and dream but has also evolved into a global symbol of creativity and innovation. The story of LEGO is one of resilience, reinvention, and a visionary approach to play.

LEGO’s origins date back to 1932 in Billund, Denmark, when Ole Kirk Christiansen, a humble carpenter, began making wooden toys. The company’s name was derived from the Danish phrase _“leg godt,”_ meaning “play well.” Initially small and family-run, LEGO faced numerous challenges, including a devastating fire that destroyed its workshop. Yet, Christiansen’s persistence paid off when, in 1949, LEGO introduced its first plastic bricks—a bold decision at a time when wood was still the standard material for toys. These innovative bricks, designed to interlock securely, laid the foundation for what would become one of the most iconic toys in history.

The following decades witnessed LEGO’s remarkable expansion. In the 1960s and 1970s, the company established international subsidiaries and created themed sets, enabling children to build miniature worlds—from space adventures to medieval castles. By the late 1990s, LEGO had become a global powerhouse. However, its rapid diversification into video games, theme parks, and even clothing strained the company’s finances. In the early 2000s, LEGO faced a severe financial crisis. Instead of collapsing, it reinvented itself by refocusing on its core product—the brick—and collaborating with popular franchises like _Star Wars_ and _Harry Potter._ This strategic shift revived its brand and propelled LEGO back to the top of the toy industry.

LEGO’s entry into the Chinese market marked another chapter in its global journey. Although it began selling in China as early as the 1990s, its real expansion gained momentum after 2010. Recognizing China’s growing middle class and the rising emphasis on education and creativity, LEGO positioned itself not just as a toy company, but as an educational brand. It opened flagship stores in major cities such as Shanghai and Beijing, launched the LEGO Education program in schools, and even built a factory in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province, to localize production and meet regional demand. In 2021, the opening of the Shanghai LEGOLAND Discovery Center and plans for a large-scale LEGOLAND theme park in Sichuan reflected LEGO’s long-term commitment to the Chinese market.

One reason behind LEGO’s success in China lies in its alignment with Chinese parents’ values. LEGO sets are not merely toys—they promote logical thinking, patience, and problem-solving skills. This educational dimension resonates deeply with families who view play as an essential part of learning. Moreover, LEGO’s localization strategy, such as introducing sets inspired by Chinese culture like the “Spring Festival” and “Monkie Kid” series, has strengthened its emotional connection with Chinese consumers.

Today, LEGO stands as a shining example of how a traditional brand can continuously evolve while staying true to its original spirit. From a small workshop in Denmark to a beloved global enterprise with deep roots in China, LEGO’s journey embodies innovation, adaptability, and the universal joy of creation. Its colorful bricks remind us that imagination truly has no borders.
