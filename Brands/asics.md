## The Development History of ASICS and Its Business Growth in China

ASICS, a globally renowned Japanese sportswear brand, has long been associated with performance, innovation, and an unshakable dedication to human well-being. The brand’s journey from a small post-war workshop to a major international player is a story of resilience and vision — one that mirrors Japan’s own rise from reconstruction to modern excellence.

The company’s origins date back to **1949**, when **Kihachiro Onitsuka** founded _Onitsuka Co., Ltd._ in Kobe, Japan. At the time, the country was still recovering from the devastation of World War II, and Onitsuka believed that sport could help rebuild both bodies and spirits. His first creation — a basketball shoe designed with suction cups inspired by an octopus — symbolized his philosophy of creativity and perseverance. Later, the company adopted the name **ASICS**, derived from the Latin phrase _“Anima Sana in Corpore Sano”_ — meaning “a sound mind in a sound body.” This timeless motto continues to guide the company’s vision: that physical activity can cultivate mental balance and social harmony.

Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, ASICS steadily expanded beyond Japan, focusing on running shoes that combined scientific design with advanced materials. By the 1980s and 1990s, ASICS had established itself as a serious competitor in the global market, particularly admired by marathoners and professional athletes for its emphasis on biomechanics and comfort. Unlike some rivals that relied heavily on marketing glamour, ASICS built its reputation on **research-based innovation**, supported by its _Institute of Sport Science_ in Kobe — a facility dedicated to studying human movement and performance.

ASICS’s entry into **the Chinese market** marked a new chapter in its international journey. In the early 2000s, as China’s economy surged and health awareness grew, ASICS seized the opportunity to promote a lifestyle centered on fitness and self-discipline. Its products, known for precision engineering and understated aesthetics, appealed to the growing middle class seeking authenticity over flashiness. The brand’s sponsorship of major marathons in cities like Shanghai and Xiamen helped strengthen its image as a symbol of endurance and mental strength.

In recent years, ASICS has deepened its presence in China through localized marketing, digital innovation, and sustainability initiatives. Collaborations with Chinese designers and sports influencers have allowed the brand to connect with younger consumers while preserving its scientific heritage. Moreover, its e-commerce strategy — particularly on platforms like Tmall and JD.com — has enabled ASICS to reach a broader audience, especially amid the digital transformation accelerated by the pandemic.

Today, ASICS stands as more than just a sportswear brand; it represents a **philosophy of balance and perseverance** that resonates deeply with Chinese consumers navigating fast-paced urban life. Its success in China is not merely commercial but cultural — a reflection of shared values such as discipline, harmony, and respect for continuous improvement.

In essence, the story of ASICS is one of **purpose-driven evolution**. From Onitsuka’s humble beginnings in Kobe to its growing influence across China’s bustling cities, ASICS has remained faithful to its core ideal: nurturing both the body and the soul through movement. And in a world increasingly defined by speed and stress, that ideal has never felt more relevant.
