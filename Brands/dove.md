## The Development History of Dove and Its Business Expansion in China

In a world filled with countless beauty brands, Dove stands out not for glamour or luxury, but for sincerity and authenticity. Its history is not only a story of marketing success but also a powerful reflection of how a brand can shape social values and redefine beauty itself.

Dove was launched in 1957 by the American company Lever Brothers, which later became part of the global giant Unilever. Its first product, the Dove Beauty Bar, was groundbreaking because it was formulated with one-quarter moisturizing cream — a gentle alternative to traditional soaps that often dried out the skin. From the very beginning, Dove positioned itself as a brand that cared about real skin and real people, not about artificial perfection. This philosophy became the foundation of its long-term identity.

Over the following decades, Dove evolved from a simple soap brand into a comprehensive personal care line, offering body washes, shampoos, lotions, and deodorants. However, what truly set Dove apart was its marketing vision. In 2004, it launched the famous **“Real Beauty” campaign**, a global movement that challenged conventional beauty standards and celebrated diversity in shape, color, and age. Instead of using professional models, Dove featured ordinary women, encouraging self-confidence and acceptance. This message resonated deeply with audiences around the world and transformed Dove into not just a product, but a symbol of empowerment.

Dove’s entry into the Chinese market came in the early 1990s, when China’s economy was rapidly opening up and consumer culture was taking shape. At first, Dove faced stiff competition from local and international skincare brands that emphasized whitening and perfection—concepts long embedded in traditional Chinese beauty ideals. Yet, Dove’s approach was refreshingly different. By focusing on care, naturalness, and emotional connection, Dove gradually won the trust of Chinese consumers, especially urban women seeking authenticity over glamour.

In China, Dove localized its strategies while maintaining its global message of “Real Beauty.” It launched campaigns that featured Chinese women with diverse appearances and stories, sparking national discussions about body confidence and inner beauty. The brand also leveraged digital platforms such as Weibo and WeChat to engage younger audiences through storytelling and social campaigns. In addition, Dove introduced products tailored to Chinese consumers’ preferences, including lighter-textured lotions and hydrating body washes suitable for local climates.

Dove’s success in China reflects more than just business growth—it highlights the cultural shift towards individuality and self-acceptance among modern Chinese consumers. By combining global values with local sensitivity, Dove has built a loyal customer base and a respected brand image that goes far beyond the cosmetics aisle.

Ultimately, Dove’s journey from a humble beauty bar to a global advocate for self-esteem demonstrates how powerful a brand can be when it connects with people’s emotions. In both the West and China, Dove has proven that beauty is not about perfection, but about confidence, kindness, and the courage to be oneself.
